- Connect +12v and GND to ECU power pins (IGN SW + CONTROL POWER and GND) ready to apply power
- Connect FTDI / CH340-based OBD adapter via K-Line to ECU K-Line pin, +12v and GND pins to same power as ECU
- Connect wire to VPP (TP13 on bottom of PCB) to be ready to connect +12v
- Connect wire to MOD1 (TP92 on bottom of PCB or HL06 on top) to be ready to connect +12v

Run software and apply power to ECU. Connect VPP wire to +12v and after that MOD1 wire to +12v. Select file to upload with "Select File"-button and click "Write Flash"-button to start kernel upload.
